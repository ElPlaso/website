    <h1>A social club for casual and competitive chess</h1>
    <p>
      The Victoria University of Wellington Chess Club is a place for chess enthusiasts to come together, share
      their love for the game, and have a good time. No matter your skill level, you're invited to be a part of the
      community.
    </p>
    <p>Our weekly meetups offer a space to enjoy casual over-the-board chess matches and work together on solving chess
      puzzles. It's all about the joy of playing and learning from one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feel free to join us at the chess club for some enjoyable games. We've got boards and clocks ready for you, but if
      you prefer your own gear, don't hesitate to bring it along.
